# Export Enhancer

This project is a Node.js script that adds additional project information from a PivotalTracker project to a PivotalTracker export such that it will appear in the comments when imported into another system such as Jira.

## Installation

If you don't have Node.js installed, you can install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) which can in turn install the current version of Node.js. Install `nvm` by running the following command:

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

After installing `nvm`, close and reopen your terminal, then verify the installation by running this command to print out the `nvm` version:

```sh
nvm -v  
```

To install the latest version of Node.js using `nvm`, run the following command:

```sh
nvm install node
```

You can verify the installation of Node.js by running:

```sh
node -v
```

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage
To run the script, use the following command with named parameters:

```sh
node export_enhancer.js --apiKey=<API_KEY> --projectId=<PROJECT_ID> --directoryPath=<DIRECTORY_PATH> --exportedStories=<EXPORTED_STORIES> --exportedHistory=<EXPORTED_HISTORY>
```

Replace `<API_KEY>`, `<PROJECT_ID>`, `<DIRECTORY_PATH>`, `<EXPORTED_STORIES>`, and `<EXPORTED_HISTORY>` with your actual Pivotal Tracker API key, project ID, the directory path where you want to save the fetched data, the file name for exported stories, and the file name for exported history respectively.

For example:

```sh
node export_enhancer.js --apiKey=abc123 --projectId=456789 --directoryPath=./data --exportedStories=stories.json --exportedHistory=history.json
```

This will fetch the project data and create a new version of the exported stories csv which is suitable for import into Jira.
